/**
 * Packet Rate Limiter - Prevents cheat clients from exploiting virtual menus.
 *
 * Problem:
 * Cheat clients like Meteor Client can send hundreds of container click packets
 * per second, potentially exploiting race conditions in shop/auction transactions
 * or causing server lag through packet flooding.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Implements a strict millisecond cooldown on incoming click packets per player UUID.
 * If a player sends a click packet before the cooldown has elapsed, the packet
 * is silently dropped. This effectively neutralizes speed-based exploits while
 * having zero impact on legitimate players who click at normal human speeds.
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - MIN_CLICK_INTERVAL_MS: Minimum milliseconds between allowed clicks (150ms)
 *   This translates to ~6.6 clicks/second maximum, which is more than enough
 *   for normal gameplay but far below what cheat clients can produce.
 * - CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS: How often to clean up stale entries (60 seconds)
 * - STALE_THRESHOLD_MS: How long before an entry is considered stale (5 minutes)
