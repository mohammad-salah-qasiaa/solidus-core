/**
 * ServerPlayerEntity Mixin - Hooks into the player's network connection
 * to intercept container click packets for virtual GUI processing.
 *
 * This mixin intercepts the handleContainerClick method on the server-side
 * packet listener. When a player clicks in any container, we check if it's
 * a Solidus virtual GUI (Shop or Auction) and route the click through our
 * custom handling pipeline with rate limiting.
 *
 * Defense-in-Depth Strategy:
 * - Primary defense: ShopScreenHandler and AuctionScreenHandler override
 *   clicked() and quickMoveStack() to block all item movement
 * - Secondary defense: This mixin intercepts packets before they reach
 *   the vanilla handler, adding rate limiting
 * - The abstract quickMoveStack is NOT targeted here (it cannot be injected
 *   into since it has no method body). Instead, the concrete overrides in
 *   our ScreenHandlers provide the protection.
 *
 * Ghost Item Prevention:
 * When the mixin cancels a container click packet on the server side, the
 * client does not immediately know about the cancellation due to network
 * latency (ping). This causes "ghost items" to appear in the player's
 * screen — items that exist on the client but not on the server.
 * After canceling, we force a container resync via broadcastChanges(),
 * which ensures the client's inventory state matches the server immediately.

    /**
     * Intercepts container click packets before vanilla processing.
     *
     * If the player has a Solidus virtual GUI open, the click is processed
     * by the PacketHandler (which applies rate limiting and routes to the
     * appropriate ScreenHandler), and the vanilla handling is cancelled.
     *
     * If the player is using a normal vanilla container, the click is
     * passed through unchanged.
     *
     * CRITICAL: After canceling a packet, we MUST call broadcastChanges()
     * to force the client to resync with the server's container state.
     * Without this, ghost items appear due to the client-server state
     * mismatch caused by network latency.
     *
     * Accessor Compatibility Note:
     * ServerboundContainerClickPacket is a Record class in Minecraft 26.1.x,
     * using record-style accessors (slotNum(), containerInput() — no get prefix).
     *
     * In 26.1.x, ServerboundContainerClickPacket now uses ContainerInput
     * instead of ClickType + separate buttonNum(). The button info is
     * absorbed into the ContainerInput.
